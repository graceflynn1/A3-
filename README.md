# Working with Data and Code, Assessment 3: Mondrian Processing Artefacts 
> A collection of three coded art pieces, developed on Processing(Java), that are inspired by the Mondrian/Neo-plasticism era, which embody the artistic expressions of that time; lines, rectangles, primary colours, blakc and white.

## General Information
- This series of artworks was developed to aid in my comprehension of code, and to strengthen my code literacy. Having a interest in art and histrical art movements, I created these works as a result to mirror my interest, along with to successfully achieve my Assessment 3.

## Technologies Used
- Processing - version 4.0.1 (Java edt.) 

## Features
List the ready features here:
- Art 1: Modelled off of Piet Mondrian's 'New York City', through the establishing of several horizontal and vertical lines, using a muted primary colour palette. 
- Art 2: Inspired by and mimics, Burgoyne Diller's 'Third form' that is created from all rectangular shapes, of varying sizes, that is also developed using a primary colour palette. 
- Art 3: Breaks down the elemsnts of the Neo-plasticism era into their basic forms of lines and rectangles, that involves the use of interactivty and a 'mousePressed' funtion.

## Setup
What are the project requirements/dependencies? Where are they listed? A requirements.txt or a Pipfile.lock file perhaps? Where is it located?

Proceed to describe how to install / setup one's local environment / get started with the project.


## Project Status
Project is:  _complete_


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- Elements of animation or interactivity could be added to Art 2: changing to inverted colours or interchanging the primary colours through a 'keyPressed' action.
